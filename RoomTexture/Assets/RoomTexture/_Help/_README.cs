/// RoomTexture is a simple asset bundle for the Unity game development
/// engine that allows for some simple texturing of room meshes created
/// by the Microsoft Hololens. By taking snapshots of the room with the
/// Hololens, you can paste these pictures to the walls, making the mesh
/// look like your room for other people looking at the mesh.
/// 
/// To get started, you may want to reference the Examples folder for
/// a pre-made scene with a working setup.
/// 
/// Otherwise, all you have to do is open the _Prefabs folder in the
/// RoomTexture folder and add the DisplayManager and TextureManager
/// prefabs to your scene. These manage the automation of texturing 
/// your room may require a few manual inputs to get things started.
/// To get specifics on how to use these, please reference their
/// appropriate help files.
